# LatamRO (ROLA) to rAthena
- This repository is only for educational purposes. I play and love Latam RO, and I am brining Latam RO official features to rAthena.
- **Probabbly only in Spanish.**

## Features
- Items DB (yeah, we have Shinny Oval Artifact)
- Items on iteminfo_c (from ROEnglishRE), we can override items to Spanish
- Cash Shop DB
  - For Account Limited Cash Shop Tab, there is a NPC seller
- Scripts for Items
  - Kafra bell
  - Zonda bell
  - Premium bell
  - Merchant bell
- NPC giving OBT Events Reward
  - Obviously I cannot sync your real rewards, so you can select any tier of reward, but only once per event.
  - Rewards are implemented on current item description and not based on website rewards, if they change when released, I'll update.
- Original rAthena Eden Group with iRO features fixes and translated to Spanish 

## Work in Progress
- Latam RO Eden Group quests.
  - Introduction quest
  - Creature Academy
  - Board quests
  - Red Hair swordman and Lumin quests

## Issues
- Latin characters like accents are not displaying properly.
- Some translations can be wrong.
- Some official features may not be 100% copy, I plan to be.
